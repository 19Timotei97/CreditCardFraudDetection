# CreditCardFraudDetection
A very simple app created for my master's degree subject, Data Mining, which uses 4 algorithms to classify transactions as fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0).

This application has a GUI written using C# that uses 2 Python scripts to load, preprocess and classify 2 datasets with transactions examples.

Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and an Aritifical Neural Network can be used to make predictions based on the training data set, 
whose size can be between 5 and 70% of the original dataset.
